Hi! I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I hope to continue my studies and pursue a Ph.D. at Tsinghua University in the next few years.

Research Interests

I am interested in Diffusion Models (DMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Hobbies
---
I love playing soccer, ice hockey, and almost any other kind of sport.

I play CS2 as well.

I enjoy having conversations with my friends, teachers, and anyone with insightful ideas.

I want to travel around the worldâ€”and I've already started my journey.
