Hi! I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I hope to continue my studies and pursue a Ph.D. at Tsinghua University in the next few years.

Research Interests
----
I am grateful for the opportunity to work in one of the most cutting-edge fields of human knowledge—teaching machines to outperform human beings. I am committed to developing myself from a student into a qualified, innovative and creative researcher.

I am interested in Diffusion Models (DMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Hobbies
---
I love playing soccer, ice hockey, and almost any other kind of sport.

I play CS2 as well.

I enjoy having conversations with my friends, teachers, and anyone with insightful ideas.

I want to travel around the world—and I've already started my journey.
